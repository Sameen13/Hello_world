# Hello_world
AHDL is a proprietary digital Hardware Description Language (HDL) from Altera Corporation for programming their Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). This language has an Ada programming language-like syntax and similar operation to VHDL or Verilog. It is supported by Altera's Quartus and Max+ series of compilers.

A disadvantage of AHDL is that it is proprietary. An advantage of AHDL is that all language constructs are synthesizable. AHDL is to Verilog much as assembly language is to a higher-level programming language: in AHDL, you have more control but less high-level support.
